nginx-uwsgi Ansible Playbook
============================

Automation for nginx and uWSGI Emperor setup. Based on my [pyweb tutorial][] and [Ansible][].

Version: 1.4 — [changelog][]

[pyweb tutorial]: https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/
[Ansible]: https://www.ansible.com/
[changelog]: https://github.com/Kwpolska/ansible-nginx-uwsgi/releases

Supported OSes
--------------

The support list matches the tutorial:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or newer
* Debian 8 (jessie) or newer
* Fedora 24 or newer (with SELinux enabled and disabled)
* CentOS 7 (with SELinux enabled and disabled)
* Arch Linux

Other operating systems are *unsupported*, because of packaging and default configuration differences.

Usage
-----

Standard Ansible Playbooks procedure. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html), edit the applicable configuration in `group_vars`, put hostnames in `hosts` (the first line is `[nginx-uwsgi]` and the following lines are `hostnames`; default is to install on localhost) and run:

    $ ansible-playbook nginx-uwsgi.yml -i hosts

To understand what the Playbook does, make sure to read the [pyweb tutorial][].

Configuration
-------------

Configuration happens in three files: `hosts`, `group_vars/all`, and `group_vars/os_<destination OS>`.

### Global (`all`)

* `app_name`: the application name, used for configuration files (default: `myapp`)
* `app_package`, `app_callable`: WSGI module to use (default: `flaskapp`, `app`)

  | Framework | Package      | Callable    | Resulting module name    | Package is…                                                                        | Callable is…                   | Caveats                                                                                    |
  |-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Flask     | filename     | app         | filename:app             | module name (for a Python import)                                                  | Flask object                   | —                                                                                          |
  | Django    | project.wsgi | application | project.wsgi:application | `project` is name of your project (directory with settings.py); `wsgi` is constant | constant                       | add an environment variable for settings: `env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.settings`  |
  | Bottle    | filename     | app         | filename:app             | module name (for a Python import)                                                  | `app = bottle.default_app()`   | —                                                                                          |
  | Pyramid   | filename     | app         | filename:app             | module name (for a Python import)                                                  | `app = config.make_wsgi_app()` | make sure it’s **not** in an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block — the demo app does that!) |

* `base_dir`: the base directory (and virtualenv) for the app (default: `/srv/myapp`)
* `appdata_dir`: the directory where app data files reside (default: `{{ base_dir }}/appdata`)
* `nginx_server_name`: hostnames the website is accessible under (default: `localhost myapp.local`)
* `nginx_http_port`: port to use when serving HTTP (default: `80`)
* `uwsgi_module`: WSGI module to use (constructed from `app_package`, `app_callable` — leave it as-is)
* `uwsgi_processes` and `uwsgi_threads`: control the resources devoted to this application. (default: `1` and `1`; should be more for bigger apps)
* `uwsgi_env`: list of environment variables to pass to the app (in key=value format; default: empty)
* `git_repo`: Git repository that contains app code (default: `https://github.com/Kwpolska/flask-demo-app`)
* `git_branch`: Git branch to pull from (default: `master`)
* `nginx_hostless_global_config`: Replace nginx.conf with one that does not have a default host. Destructive, see caveat below! (default: `no`)

### Global with different values for every OS

* `uid`: user used for files and sockets
* `gid`: group used for files and sockets
* `nginx_dir`: nginx sites directory (conf.d or sites-enabled)
* `uwsgi_dir`: uWSGI vassals directory
* `uwsgi_plugins`: uWSGI plugins (`python3,logfile` or `python`)
* `uwsgi_service_name`: uWSGI systemd service name (`uwsgi` or `emperor.uwsgi`)

### OS-specific

* `nginx_patch_confd_Archlinux`: patch `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to use `conf.d` (default: `yes`; may fail)
* `nginx_disable_default_site`: disable the default site by removing `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` (default: `yes`; for Debian/Ubuntu)
* `skip_selinux`: skip SELinux tasks (default: `no`; for CentOS/Fedora)

Caveats
-------

### Special dependencies

Make sure you have the following packages installed first on the *destination* machine (Ansible dependencies):

* Debian/Ubuntu: `python`
* Fedora: `python2 python2-dnf libselinux-python`
* CentOS: `python libselinux-python`
* Arch Linux: `python2`

### nginx default site configuration (All OSes)

The default config of nginx creates some servers with default pages. Not everyone wants that. If you want this playbook to *replace* your nginx.conf file with one that has no servers (based on your OSes default `nginx.conf`), set `nginx_hostless_global_config` to `yes`. You should not use it if you customized /etc/nginx/nginx.conf in any way, or if you have installed and configured nginx before. On Ubuntu and Debian, `nginx_disable_default_site` is less destructive and enabled by default.

### nginx host config is very basic — HTTPS needs extra work (All OSes)

The nginx host config is rudimentary and does not include SSL/TLS support and custom error pages. For the former, see [Remy van Elst’s guide](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html).

### nginx conf.d support (Arch Linux)

By default, nginx on Arch Linux does not have any modular-include config directory. This playbook (and best practices) recommend having one for cleaner config. This playbook will try to patch your configuration file, but if you configured nginx in a way that makes the patch fail, you need to manually add this snippet to your `server {}` block:

```nginx
# Load modular configuration files from the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory.
# See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include
# for more information.
include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*;
```

Afterwards, disable patching — set `nginx_patch_confd_Archlinux` to `no`. You should also disable this patch if you already used this playbook, or have a modular configuration directory already (you can change the path in config).

### virtualenvs use symlinks

If you’re installing to a place that doesn’t like symlinks — for example,
a VM shared folder (eg. ``/vagrant``) on a Windows host, you may get a
*Protocol error* pointing to a ``os.symlink`` call in ``virtualenv.py``. You
can fix this by amending the virtualenv command to use ``--always-copy``, or by
using a more reasonable place to store your virtualenv (a Unix filesystem, that
is).
